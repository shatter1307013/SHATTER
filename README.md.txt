Smart Home Analytics for Threats TargetingEnergy Routine

Modern smart home control systems employ activity monitoring systems for efficient control, improving occupants' comfort and productivity, elderly monitoring, and so forth. For instance, to ensure occupants' comfort and optimal energy consumption, the smart home control systems adopt demand control heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) control systems accounting for real-time occupancy status. Additionally, the HVAC controllers may leverage machine learning (ML)-based abnormality detection models (ADMs) to detect adversarial manipulation through measurement inconsistencies. However, sufficient system knowledge allows adversaries/attackers to exploit the sensor measurement stealthily and launch sophisticated cyberattacks, popularly known as stealthy false data injection (FDI) attacks, and compromise indoor air quality and/or energy consumption/cost of the smart home. Although the incorporation of ADSs limits the attack scope, the availability of information like occupants' exact location and/or their conducted activities as well alteration capability of smart internet of things (IoT)-enabled appliances, let the attackers learn more about the smart home states and creates more stealthy attack opportunity for them through intelligently activating/ turning on some inactive appliances without alarming the system or the occupants. The existing smart home/building security analysis works based on FDI attacks do not concern activity recognition, appliance triggering, and ML-based activity recognition and hence produce some unnecessary and insufficient attack vectors not applicable in a modern smart home context. We address this problem and propose a novel framework that analyzes the threat space of such a smart IoT-enabled home control system, efficiently taking ADM rules extracted through an efficient algorithm. We evaluate the proposed attack analyzer's effectiveness on two home information of the Activity Recognition with Ambient Sensing (ARAS) dataset. We also build a prototype testbed for validating the framework in real-life settings.
